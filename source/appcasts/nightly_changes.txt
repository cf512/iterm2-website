password manager. Issue 9972

2021-10-18: Fix bound keystrokes while filtering/zooming.
Issue 9976

2021-10-18: Fix data race in metal renderer (private queue
used same external attributes index as main queue, which
mutates it concurrently). Issue 9989

2021-10-15: Send esc+nul for C-M-Space. Issue 9962

2021-10-14: Turn off automatic everything substitution in
edit snippets value. It was turned off in IB, no idea why
that didn't work. Issue 9987

2021-10-14: Fix a bug where tmux integration didn't work
with tmux 1.8

2021-10-14: Send C-Space to tmux for null since it doesn't
handle 0x0 correctly. Issue 9963

2021-10-14: Enlarge text field for actions that take string
params. Issue 9967

2021-10-14: Show display title in snippets menu rather than
title (i.e., use the value if the title is empty)

2021-10-14: Add 'compose' action to open composer with text.
Issue 9966

2021-10-13: Perform a one-shot tail find when you do
find-next or find-previous to pick up anything new. Issue
9964.

2021-10-13: Stop filtering if the status bar is removed

2021-10-13: Fix a bug where the status bar filter component
didn't get a progress bar.

Make textview first responder after filtering stops.

Reset progress when stopping filtering to avoid a
half-complete progress bar when opening the search field
subsequently.

Visual improvements in drop down view so filter field
matches search field on 10.16.

2021-10-13: [filter] Remove verbatim updater. It was slow
because it handled the whole session contents synchronously.
Empty queries now cancel filtering. Issue 9979

2021-10-12: Initialize scroller style for issue 9946

2021-10-12: Change DA2 xterm version to 2500. This gives
ideal behavior in both vim and emacs.

2021-10-12: Exclude arrow keys, page up, page down, home,
end and delete from numeric keypad for key mapping. This
fixes arrow keys in vim

2021-10-12: Implement tertiary DA. Update DA1 to 369.
Implement DECNLS response for DECRQSS. Change default VT
level to 400. YOLO

2021-10-11: Implement SPA, EPA, DECSCA, DECSERA, DECSED, and
DECSEL. Report selective erase support in DECRQSS.

Split enumerateCellsInRect into a mutable & immutable
methods.

Fix a bug where Primary DA would respond when the parameter
is not 0.

2021-10-11: Move URL out of screen_char_t and in to
iTermExternalAttributes.

This required adding a migration path from the now-legacy
screen_char_t that had a URL code to the modern one that has
16 bits of unused space. This was motivated by the desire to
support the protected attribute and to add new attributes
more easily in the future. This also gets us 32-bit URL
codes, which ought to be enough for anyone. I also fixed a
bug where NSURLs were saved in VT100Terminal's restorable
state when OSC 8 is in effect (rare, but breaks decoding).
Fix a crash when VT100Grid fails to import a broken
restorable state dictionary. Update DVR to import/export
external attributes. Fix a bug in iTermURLStore that used up
codes unnecessarily quickly.

2021-10-11: Don't crash if we fail to restore the primary
grid from restorable state.

2021-10-11: Add Setulc (underline color support) to my fork
of xterm-256color

control sequence

2021-10-08: Implement DECCARA. Add an inverse flag to
screen_char_t so we know which cells are inverse video to
make DECCARA work right.

2021-10-08: Add support for double underline to HTML logs

2021-10-08: Implement DECIC, DECDC

2021-10-08: Implement DECSNLS

2021-10-08: Add support for DECSPP reporting to DECRQSS

2021-10-08: - Implement XTPUSHSGR and XTPOPSGR - Implement
DECSCPP - Fix DECCOLM to reset margins on change and to
preserve the cursor's position.

2021-10-08: Implement most of DEC DSR

clear screen when DECCOLM is set/reset

2021-10-08: Add DECSET 12 (blinking cursor)

2021-10-07: Update the response to primary DA and start
adding support for VT level 400

2021-10-07: Fix application keypad mode (it was broken by
adding keymappers because it needs to run pre-cocoa but I
hadn't tested it for lack of a keypad at the time). Add
DEC[RE]SET 66. Make it work in modifyOtherKeys modes. Send
modifiers.

2021-10-07: Add support for CSI a

2021-10-07: Accept CSI ` (HPA) as a synonym for CSI G (CHA)

2021-10-06: Add support for SR (shift right)

2021-10-06: Add support for SL (Shift left).

2021-10-06: Fix a bug where scroll regions got corrupted
weirdly (leaving illegal values) after a resize.

2021-10-06: Add support XTSETTCAP. Change how XTGETTCAP
works for TN, which now returns the termcap name (e.g.,
xterm-new) rather than the terminal emulator name. This will
probably break some people's scripts. They can use another
test, such as whether you get a response for iTerm2Profile
instead of TN.

2021-10-06: Add support for DECRSPS

2021-10-06: Add support for DECRQPSR

2021-10-06: Remove debugging code

2021-10-05: Add support for DECFI

2021-10-04: Various improvements to sending key events.

- Function keys now communicate modifiers when TERM starts
with `xterm`.  - Rewrite modify other keys mode=1 to fix a
lot of problems. Issue 9962.  - Control-backspace now sends
c-h - Fix various other weird edge cases I spotted in xterm
(c-m-backspace sends CSI; meta+special control (i.e., c-2 or
c-6) now does esc + special control)

2021-10-03: Add some guardrails for the toolbelt font
setting to avoid a crash. Issue 9940

2021-10-02: Fix a bug where cmd-enter wouldn't toggle
fullscreen for a hotkey window when native fullscreen was
enabled. Issue 9949

2021-10-02: Fix a bug where the ligature warning was shown
for fonts that have default ligatures (currently none) or
fonts that don't support ligatures and it wasn't updated
when changing fonts

2021-10-02: ESC c now restores profile colors to the values
from the underlying profile. Since OSC 4 can change them
it's only fair that you can reset them. This might cause
problems if people are manually tweaking their profiles and
expecting it to stick, but restoring values to the last
human-set color would introduce gobs of complexity. Issue
9948

2021-10-01: Only hide tabbar backing's visual effect view
when in the minimal theme. Fixes a bug where the regular
theme with a transparent window would have no backing,
making tabs transparent.

2021-10-01: Rebuild terminfo with old tic

2021-10-01: Add interpolated string for autolog filename.
Issue 9947

tools

2021-09-28: Add advanced pref for toolbelt font. Issue 9940

2021-09-28: Make minimal tabbar and statusbar translucent
like its window. Tweak appearance of search, filter, and
composer on big sur and later to fit the status bar
aesthetic better.

2021-09-28: Rename bookmark to profile in PrefsPanel.m

2021-09-28: Fix ubsan error about float cast overflow

prefs

2021-09-27: Allow to broadcast Clear. Issue 5682

2021-09-27: Don't give the label in the session title view a
background color in macOS 11+. It should be able to
composite correctly.

2021-09-27: Fix frame of drop-down find view

2021-09-27: Fix a bug where expanding a disclosure in an
alert didn't resize the alert in big sur. Issue 9929

live up to the promises we make in terminfo.

2021-09-27: Rebuild terminfo files with tic 6.2 to fix
pairs#0. See email with subject line 'iTerm2 3.5.0beta1 with
Epsilon 14'

2021-09-26: Avoid unnecessary jiggling. Jiggle on bg/fg
color change was added for issue 9855. This commit prevents
jiggle during session initialization or on transparency
change since that confuses your shell. Issue 9923

2021-09-26: Fix hiding individual status bar components so
that when there are two of the same class (which can only
happen for RPC-provided components) it can find the right
one to remove.

2021-09-26: Add support for HTML formatted status bar
components.

2021-09-26: Regen menu_ids.rst

2021-09-26: Add venv python API example

2021-09-23: Fix wrong text color in non-selected tabs when
one tab has a tab color. Issue 9367

2021-09-22: Add external attributes.

See external_attrs branch for unsquashed commits.

empty string - Fix a bug in filtering where streaming with

iTermToolbeltView

2021-09-13: Ensure TextViewWrapper's frame is at least as
tall as its enclosing scroll view's content size. Issue 9799

2021-09-11: Reverse index in search field when not swapping
search direction. Issue 9902

2021-09-10: Remove search results on screen when the whole
grid is marked dirty. We did this when an individual line
was dirty, so it makes sense to do it for the whole screen
too. It fixes a bug where switching from alt screen to main
screen leaves the now-invisible search results behind. Issue
9892, commentt written 9/9/21 11:38am PDT

2021-09-10: Add more debug logging for issue 9286

navigating marks/annotations didn't work with legacy
renderer. Issue 9898

2021-09-07: Save scroll position and search query when
entering zoom and restore it when leaving.

2021-09-07: Allow metal to be enabled on terminated
sessions. Fixes a bug where scrolling does not update the
view. The bug was introduced by
72b2f8dd29253d19d982a4e949a598d81bbc0d99 in an attempt to
reduce unecessary drawing of a terminated session. I'm not
able to reproduce that now and it was obviously wrong. This
commit changes it to test for a missing window instead,
which is almost certainly never going to happen. Issue 9836.

2021-09-07: Improve debug logging for scrolling

2021-09-06: Fix warning

2021-09-06: Remove AddressBook.framework as a dependency

is visible. This costs a bit of performance but unbreaks
annotations

2021-09-02: Add support for filtering.

See the filter branch for individual commits.
