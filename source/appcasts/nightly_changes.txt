2021-10-04: Various improvements to sending key events.

- Function keys now communicate modifiers when TERM starts
with `xterm`.  - Rewrite modify other keys mode=1 to fix a
lot of problems. Issue 9962.  - Control-backspace now sends
c-h - Fix various other weird edge cases I spotted in xterm
(c-m-backspace sends CSI; meta+special control (i.e., c-2 or
c-6) now does esc + special control)

2021-10-03: Add some guardrails for the toolbelt font
setting to avoid a crash. Issue 9940

2021-10-02: Fix a bug where cmd-enter wouldn't toggle
fullscreen for a hotkey window when native fullscreen was
enabled. Issue 9949

2021-10-02: Fix a bug where the ligature warning was shown
for fonts that have default ligatures (currently none) or
fonts that don't support ligatures and it wasn't updated
when changing fonts

2021-10-02: ESC c now restores profile colors to the values
from the underlying profile. Since OSC 4 can change them
it's only fair that you can reset them. This might cause
problems if people are manually tweaking their profiles and
expecting it to stick, but restoring values to the last
human-set color would introduce gobs of complexity. Issue
9948

2021-10-01: Only hide tabbar backing's visual effect view
when in the minimal theme. Fixes a bug where the regular
theme with a transparent window would have no backing,
making tabs transparent.

2021-10-01: Rebuild terminfo with old tic

2021-10-01: Add interpolated string for autolog filename.
Issue 9947

tools

composite correctly.

2021-09-27: Fix a bug where expanding a disclosure in an

live up to the promises we make in terminfo.

2021-09-27: Rebuild terminfo files with tic 6.2 to fix
pairs#0. See email with subject line 'iTerm2 3.5.0beta1 with
Epsilon 14'

2021-09-26: Avoid unnecessary jiggling. Jiggle on bg/fg
color change was added for issue 9855. This commit prevents
jiggle during session initialization or on transparency
change since that confuses your shell. Issue 9923

2021-09-26: Fix hiding individual status bar components so
that when there are two of the same class (which can only
happen for RPC-provided components) it can find the right
one to remove.

2021-09-26: Add support for HTML formatted status bar
components.

2021-09-26: Regen menu_ids.rst

2021-09-26: Add venv python API example

2021-09-11: Reverse index in search field when not swapping
search direction. Issue 9902

2021-09-10: Remove search results on screen when the whole
grid is marked dirty. We did this when an individual line
was dirty, so it makes sense to do it for the whole screen
too. It fixes a bug where switching from alt screen to main
screen leaves the now-invisible search results behind. Issue

2021-09-07: Allow metal to be enabled on terminated
sessions. Fixes a bug where scrolling does not update the
view. The bug was introduced by
72b2f8dd29253d19d982a4e949a598d81bbc0d99 in an attempt to
reduce unecessary drawing of a terminated session. I'm not
able to reproduce that now and it was obviously wrong. This
commit changes it to test for a missing window instead,
which is almost certainly never going to happen. Issue 9836.
