3.4.11

This version of iTerm2 was built with Xcode 13 for
macOS Monterey.

Bug Fixes
- The menu items that select a broadcast mode are
  now toggles. This fixes a bug introduced in
  3.4.10 where they lost the ability to turn
  broadcasting off.
- Fix a bug where cmd-enter wouldn't toggle full
  screen mode for hotkey windows when native full
  screen mode was enabled.
- Fix a bug where control-space would not work
  correctly in tmux integration.
- Improve visibility of non-selected tabs when one
  tab has a custom tab color.
- Enable compatibility mode for displays with
  notches.
