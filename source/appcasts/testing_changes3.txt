- Emacs and Python now get the correct tab icons.
- Rate limit alerts and notification triggers to
  avoid spamming you to death.

Bug fixes

  fullscreen for a hotkey window when native
  fullscreen was enabled.
- Control-backspace now sends ^H.
- Fix DECRQCRA interpretation of params (first is
  now request ID).
- Fix corrupted scroll regions after a resize.
- Fix application keypad mode.
- Fix DECCOLM to reset margins on change and to
  preserve the cursor's position.
- Work around a bug in old versions of tmux where
  they didn't accept control-space like other
  keys, causing 0x0 to be printed.
- Fix tmux integration for tmux 1.8.
- Turn off smart substitution in the snippets
  value text view.
- Open hotkey windows beneath menu bar when
  opening over another app's fullscreen window.
- Fix the appearance of dragged tabs.
- Fix flashing white line at top of screen in dark
  mode full screen.
- Fix discrepancy between GPU and non-GPU renderer

- OSC no longer requires a semicolon after the
  mode if there is no argument.
- Fix a bug where both a per-pane and per-window
  gbackground iamge could be visible at the same
  time.
- Turn off mouse movement trac king when it isn't
  needed to reduce idle CPU.
- Fix discrepancy in rendering of composed
  characters in GPU renderer vs legacy renderer.
- When "Enable full keyboard access" is turned on
  in system prefs, iTerm2 now accepts the spacebar
  as input.
- Hotkey windows now appear beneath notification
  center messages.
- Restore window title when unburying a session
  that causes the window to be resurrected.
- Fix a bug where "Duplicate Tab" would duplicate
  the current tab, not the one belonging to the
  context menu.
- Fix cmd-clicking on URLs without a scheme but
  with a fragment.

Breaking Changes
- Change XTGETTCAP's response to "TN" to give
  $TERM rather than the name of the terminal
  emulator. This will probably break your code if
  you relied on it..
- The response to Primary DA now indicates VT
  level 400. Hopefully this doesn't break
  anything, but it's hard to test!  Please let me
  know if programs start misbehaving.
- The response to Secondary DA now gives xterm
  patch level 2500. This unlocks features in some
  apps (like better key handling in Emacs) but
  will probably break things I don't know exist.
